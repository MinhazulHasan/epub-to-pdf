        "contentSource": " Check the coolant level in the reservoir tank when the motor is cold. If the coolant level is below the MIN level 2 add coolant up to the MAX level 1. If the reservoir tank is empty, check the coolant level in the radiator when the motor is cold. If there is insufficient coolant in the radiator, fill the radiator with coolant up to the filler opening and also add it to the reservoir tank up to the MAX level 1. If the cooling system frequently requires coolant, have it checked by a knowledgeable ARIYA repairer such as a NISSAN certified electric vehicle dealer."
