When using the NISSAN EVSE with a domestic electrical socket, it is important to understand that the NISSAN ARIYA draws a high continuous electrical current which could lead to concerns if the electrical wiring and socket do not comply with the latest national regulations, or if they have been installed incorrectly or not properly maintained.  Should the red light come on, a fault in the charging system has been detected. In that case, consult a knowledgeable NISSAN\u00a0ARIYA repairer such as a NISSAN certified electric vehicle dealer.    1 Outlet plug NISSAN EVSE: Insert the outlet plug into a dedicated 220\u00a0\u2013\u00a0240\u00a0V AC power outlet  2 Safety cap Be sure to refit the safety cap once charging has finished TIP: Please refer to the NISSAN\u00a0ARIYA Owner\u2019s Manual for additional details on the various statuses that can be indicated by the control box indicator lights."

Detection zone The radar sensors can detect vehicles on either side of your vehicle within the detection zone shown as illustrated. This detection zone starts from the outside mirror of your vehicle and extends approximately 3.0\u00a0m (10 ft) behind the rear bumper, and approximately 3.0 m (10 ft) sideways.   1 Side indicator light 2 Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention ON indicator (on the vehicle information display) 3 Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention indicator (on the vehicle information display) 4 Dynamic driver assistance switch (models without ProPILOT Assist system) 5 ProPILOT Assist switch (models with\u00a0ProPILOT Assist system) The Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention system operates above approximately 60 km/h (37MPH). If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the detection zone, the side indicator light illuminates. If the turn signal is then activated, the system chimes (twice) and the side indicator light and Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention indicator flash. The side indicator light and BSW indicator continue to flash until the detected vehicle leaves the detection zone. If the Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention system is ON and your vehicle approaches a lane marker while another vehicle is in the detection zone, the system chimes (three times) and the side indicator light and Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention indicator flash.  The Intelligent blind Spot Intervention system activates by applying the brakes on one side of the vehicle for a short period of time to help return the vehicle back to the center of the driving lane. The Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention system operates regardless of turn signal usage. To turn on the Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention system, push the ProPILOT Assist switch on the steering wheel or the dynamic driver assistance switch on the driver\u2019s side instrument panel after starting the EV system. The Intelligent Blind Spot Intervention ON indicator on the vehicle information display will illuminate.
